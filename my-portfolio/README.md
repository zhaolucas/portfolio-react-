# Challenge 13: React Portfolio

## Description 

This challenge will develop the initial scaffolding of portfolio site.

The site should look "polished" and "professional"; that means: mobile-first design,  a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site, and the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
